### Description
The term audit has many different uses and is dependent on the context used. FSA Operations Audits of approved establishments within operations will focus on the FBO’s processes rather than used to demonstrate the compliance with of food/feed safety law.  Focusing of their food safety management system, larger firms will have a HACCP system in place that will be audited. [inspections](inspections.md) will focus on the compliance of food/feed safety.

There are three high level types of audit carried out

*   1st Audit also known as an internal audit (carried out by audit and assurance team)
*   2nd Audit also known as subcontracted audit, this is where the FSA audit's organisations that carry out activities on behalf of the FSA.
*   3rd Audit also known as a third party audit where FSA audits a local authority or other Competent Authority on how they are carrying out official controls that relate to food or feed.

These high level types of Audit can be sub-categorised further

*   Compliance audits - This is where the auditor verifies the correct systems are in place and are being used within an approved establishment
*   System audits - similar to compliance audit but focuses on the systems in place are suitable and fit for purpose rather than the results
*   Focused audits – looking at a specific area of the official controls or activities (e.g. approved establishments, enforcement, allergens)
*   Product audit - is the assessment of the final product/service and its qualification for use
*   Partial audit (on part of a system) These are usually done due to time pressures so an audit be broken up into separate visits each visit will focus on a specific area with the intention of auditing the complete system over a set period of time.
*   Financial audit -  is assessing the financial health of a business the FSA. Internal auditors look for unauthorized spending, misallocated expenses and other accounting errors. They compare each department's spending against the annual budget.

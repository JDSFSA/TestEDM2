### Pattern created

## Description

A telephone number is a sequence of digits used to connect to a fixed line or wireless device.  

Telephone numbers should only be collected and stored if there is a genuine need.

Telephone numbers should not be split into geographical and subscriber numbers as there is little benefit.

## Field formats, data types, and patterns

Telephone number should be stored as a string entry in a single field, in order to preserve leading zeros and potential special characters used for international dialling codes and formatting (eg +, (), -).

A field length of 20 would allow for the following examples plus other international variants and spaces (guidelines within E.146 - International Telephone Formats would restrict to 15 characters for international numbers, 3 for country code and 12 for subscriber number, with all spaces and special characters removed (excluding '+' symbol for country code)).

-   `01xxx xxxxxx`
-   `01xx xxx xxxx`
-   `020 xxxx xxxx`
-   `01xx xx xxxxx`
-   `+44 xxxx xxxx xxxx`

## Notes

FSA use telephone numbers primarily to send alerts using the gov.uk Notify service.  Please see the relevant API documentation available through the reference below.
